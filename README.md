# hitbox
This is a collection of stl files I have used for my 3d printed hitbox enclosure, The finished product looks something like this. Note that this hitbox is in southpaw and is reversed from the default. If you would like a standard hitbox layout you will have to use the orthrodox hitbox stl file for the base

Besides the 3d printed parts, you are going to need 9 30mm buttons, 6 24mm buttons, a microcontroller, 6 m3x50mm screws, a neutrik passthrough, and 2 usb cables depending on your microcontroller and passthrough choice. For the people who don't want to solder, Brook sells fighting game boards for $20-100 that are compatible with a few wiring harnesses. However, you can cut a lot of costs by using an rp2040 and downloading the appropriate gp2040 uf2 file from the gp2040 website [here](https://gp2040-ce.info/downloads/), and loading the uf2 onto your microcontroller. If you do this, you will be soldering and if you want to use quick disconnects also crimping. However, gp2040 has compatibility with ps5, you can get an rp2040 microcontroller for around 7$ and the soldering is relatively easy.

If you use a brook board the inside will look something like this:
